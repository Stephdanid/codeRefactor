This is a refactoring of the html and css files provided and changing the html from syntax to semantic as requested and optimizing css code. I beganby putting in sections and getting away from the div tag. I was able to put in a proper header, main tag, article tag, and a nav tag into their corresponding places keeping the web page in working order. I was able to connect the formatting on css by changing the appropiate tags and classes.
